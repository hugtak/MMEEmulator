This file contains a brief description of the original ASN.1 Studio project
structure as well as an overview of the resulting project structure.

The structure of the original ASN.1 Studio project
==================================================

ASN.1 Files
	../../../../asn1studio/linux-x86-64bit/Asn1Standards/3GPP/29-series/SBCAP/v16.0.0/sbcap.asn

The structure of the exported project
=====================================

makefile
	This is the main makefile.

SBCAP_MME.cmd
	This is an OSS command file that is used to compile the ASN.1
	files. The exported project contains a custom build step that
	uses this file.

Generated files
---------------

Readme.txt
	This file.

sbcap.h
	This header file will be (re)created by the ASN.1/C++ compiler during
	a custom build step. This step uses the OSS command file that
	was generated by ASN.1 Studio during the project export.

sbcap.cpp
	This source file will be (re)created by the ASN.1/C++ compiler during
	a custom build step. This step uses the OSS command file that
	was generated by ASN.1 Studio during the project export.

ASN.1 files
-----------

../../../../asn1studio/linux-x86-64bit/Asn1Standards/3GPP/29-series/SBCAP/v16.0.0/sbcap.asn
	This ASN.1 file is compiled by the ASN.1/C++ compiler during a
	custom build step.

Source files
------------

General_func.cpp
Principal.cpp
Sbc_func.cpp
Sctp_func.cpp
	These source files were taken from the "User Files" folder of an
	ASN.1 Studio project.

Header files
------------

General_func.h
Principal.h
Sbc_func.h
Sctp_func.h
	These files were taken from the "User Files" folder of an
	ASN.1 Studio project.
	They were not recognized as source files, and were therefore placed in 
	the header files list.
